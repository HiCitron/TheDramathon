		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>When is it?</h3>
			<p>20th October 2018.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>When's / Where's registration?</h3>
			<p>Friday 19th October 2018 at Glenfarclas Distillery or early on Saturday 20th October 2018 at Glenfiddich distillery. More details closer to the time.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>What does my registration fee include?</h3>
			<p>Expert first aid, regular feed stations, samples of single malt whiskies, a medal, dibber timing technology, professional digital photographs, a technical T-shirt, free parking at Glenfiddich, transportation to race start, safety, security, access to toilet facilities at start and finish as well as on the route itself.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>What's the terrain like?</h3>
			<p>The route uses The Speyside Way mainly over forest tracks and footpaths with some occasional hilly terrain which may be boggy.  There is only a very short stretch of  road running along minor roads and all road crossings are marshalled. Please wear trail shoes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>Where do I park?</h3>
			<p>Some carparking facilities at Glenfiddich distillery (the finish line for all events). All participants should leave their vehicles at Glenfiddich or in Dufftown. The Marathon runners (and the 1st and 2nd leg relay runners) will be taken by bus to the start at Glenfarclas (Relay 2nd Leg to Ballindalloch). The Half-Marathon runners (and the 3rd leg relay runners) will be taken by bus to the start of their start at Tamdhu.  The 10K and 4th leg relay runners will be taken by bus to the their start at Aberlour. Then all you have to do is run back to Glenfiddich.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>Do you provide Timing technology?</h3>
			<p>We certainly do :  Our equipment is the 'dibber' type that is widely used in Adventure Racing and Orienteering (including the World Championships where there's no back-up system, and 100% accuracy is vital) </p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>What's all this about single malt whisky?</h3>
			<p>Well, it's The Dramathon - when you get to the end of the race we'll give you samples of the single malts corresponding to the distance you ran.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>I don't like single malt whisky.  Why should I do this race?</h3>
			<p>Maybe your friends like whisky ;-)  The whisky is optional, the atmosphere will be great and the route is out of this world.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>What about feed stations and first aid?</h3>
			<p>There are feed stations at regular intervals along the route providing water and fruit etc.  Specialised first aid teams are on hand if needs be and the event is supported by a number of marshalls who can offer assistance if necessary.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>How do I get to Speyside? Where should I stay? I love running and single malts but my other half doesn't - what else is there to do?</h3>
			<p>Our friends over at The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival have already thought about all of this.  Take a look at their site <a href="http://www.spiritofspeyside.com/planning_your_visit">here</a> as well as Moray Speyside Tourism's website at <a href="http://www.morayspeyside.com/">www.morayspeyside.com</a> which has information about places to stay, restaurants and so on.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>What about cut off times?</h3>
			<p>We have a couple of cut offs – if you arrive after these times your race will stop and you’ll be transported back to the Finish. No arguments.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;2pm @ Tamdhu Station (Marathon and Relay courses)<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;4pm @ Aberlour (Marathon, Half Marathon, and Relay courses)</p>
			<p>We also reserve the right to cut Runners off at the Feed Stations and bring them back to the Finish by vehicle. This will be at our discretion.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<br>
			<h3>Can I run with my dog?</h3>
			<p>We're afraid not.</p>
